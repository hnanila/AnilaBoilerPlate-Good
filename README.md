# Timeline

-  1968: Beranek and Newman Inc. (BBN) unveils the final version of the Interface Message Processor (IMP) specifications. BBN wins ARPANET contract
- 1969: On Oct. 29, UCLA’s Network Measurement Center, Stanford Research Institute (SRI), University of California-Santa Barbara and University of Utah install nodes.
          * The first message is "LO," which was an attempt by student Charles Kline to "LOGIN" to the SRI computer from the university.
          However, the message was unable to be completed because the SRI system crashed.
- 1972:BBN’s Ray Tomlinson introduces network email. The Internetworking Working Group (INWG) forms to address need for establishing standard protocols.
- 1973: Global networking becomes a reality as the University College of London (England) and Royal Radar Establishment (Norway) connect to ARPANET.
                  The term Internet is born
- 1974: The first Internet Service Provider (ISP) is born with the introduction of a commercial version of ARPANET, known as Telenet.
- 1981: The National Science Foundation (NSF) provided a grant to establish the Computer Science Network (CSNET) to provide networking services to university computer scientists.
- 1982: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), as the protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, emerge as the protocol for ARPANET.
This results in the fledgling definition of the Internet as connected TCP/IP internets.
TCP/IP remains the standard protocol for the Internet
- 1983: The Domain Name System (DNS) establishes the familiar .edu, .gov, .com, .mil, .org, .net, and .int system for naming websites.
This is easier to remember than the previous designation for websites, such as 123.456.789.1
- 1985: Symbolics.com, the website for Symbolics Computer Corp. in Massachusetts, becomes the first registered domain
- 1989:   The World wide web was invented by Sir Timothy John "Tim" Berners-Lee, an engineer and computer scientist from Great Britin, working as a professor at MIT and CERN Laboratory
- 1991: The first line browser (called www) was used on the CERN network.
- 1992: WWW browser was available for download via FTP by CERN. This was the big start for the world wide web.
- 1993: The National Science Foundation created InterNic which consists of three organizations:
  - AT&T to handle database services
  - Network Solutions, Inc. to handle host and domain name registrations and IP assignments
  - General Atomics to handle information services
- 1994: The Internet grows significantly since it was open for commercial use. The National Science Foundation announced the following four major network access points (NAPS):
  - San Francisco by Pac Bell
  - Chicago by Ameritech
  - New York by Sprint
  - Washington DC by Metropolitan Fiber Systems

# GitHub Definitions 

 - GIT: A distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
 
- GIThub: A web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code

- Repository: Generically refers to a central place where data is stored and maintained

- Clone: Creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project’s files, history, and branches.

- Commit: Saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo.

- Push: Updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch

- Pull: Updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.

- Branch: Shows each section of being worked on locally.

- Merge: This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the master branch for deployment.

- Merge Conflict: Sometimes when you get merge conflicts when merging or pulling from a branch. It will tell you to fix it and and then commit your results. 

- Fetch: Related to getting, reading, or moving data objects

- Remote: A user does not have physical access, but which he or she can access or manipulate via some kind of computer network.
