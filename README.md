# Timeline

-  1968: Beranek and Newman Inc. (BBN) unveils the final version of the Interface Message Processor (IMP) specifications. BBN wins ARPANET contract
- 1969: On Oct. 29, UCLA’s Network Measurement Center, Stanford Research Institute (SRI), University of California-Santa Barbara and University of Utah install nodes.
          * The first message is "LO," which was an attempt by student Charles Kline to "LOGIN" to the SRI computer from the university.
          However, the message was unable to be completed because the SRI system crashed.
- 1972:BBN’s Ray Tomlinson introduces network email. The Internetworking Working Group (INWG) forms to address need for establishing standard protocols.
- 1973: Global networking becomes a reality as the University College of London (England) and Royal Radar Establishment (Norway) connect to ARPANET.
                  The term Internet is born
- 1974: The first Internet Service Provider (ISP) is born with the introduction of a commercial version of ARPANET, known as Telenet.
- 1981: The National Science Foundation (NSF) provided a grant to establish the Computer Science Network (CSNET) to provide networking services to university computer scientists.
- 1982: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), as the protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP, emerge as the protocol for ARPANET.
This results in the fledgling definition of the Internet as connected TCP/IP internets.
TCP/IP remains the standard protocol for the Internet
- 1983: The Domain Name System (DNS) establishes the familiar .edu, .gov, .com, .mil, .org, .net, and .int system for naming websites.
This is easier to remember than the previous designation for websites, such as 123.456.789.1
- 1985: Symbolics.com, the website for Symbolics Computer Corp. in Massachusetts, becomes the first registered domain
- 1989:   The World wide web was invented by Sir Timothy John "Tim" Berners-Lee, an engineer and computer scientist from Great Britin, working as a professor at MIT and CERN Laboratory
- 1991: The first line browser (called www) was used on the CERN network.
- 1992: WWW browser was available for download via FTP by CERN. This was the big start for the world wide web.
- 1993: The National Science Foundation created InterNic which consists of three organizations:
  - AT&T to handle database services
  - Network Solutions, Inc. to handle host and domain name registrations and IP assignments
  - General Atomics to handle information services
- 1994: The Internet grows significantly since it was open for commercial use. The National Science Foundation announced the following four major network access points (NAPS):
  - San Francisco by Pac Bell
  - Chicago by Ameritech
  - New York by Sprint
  - Washington DC by Metropolitan Fiber Systems
